NuggetList is a lightweight Blacklist/Whitelist addon created for purpose of making grouping less tedious by filtering good and bad players.

Commands:
/nl

/nuggetlist

It adds a little red or green 'N' icon next to set player's name anytime they type in chat so you always know who you're dealing with.

When you open 'Add Player' prompt window you can just left click player's name in chat to copy it instantly to reduce hassle when dealing with special (people) characters in names.

You can import and export the list between your friends freely as well, it doesn't overwrite your own list rather adds names you're missing.

It also auto sells gray items whenever you hit a vendor and auto-types 'delete' when you try to delete an epic quality+ item.

Works with 5.4.8 as well as 7.3.5 clients.
