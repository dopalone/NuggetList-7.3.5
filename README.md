NuggetList is a lightweight Blacklist/Whitelist addon created for purpose of making grouping less tedious by filtering good and bad players.

Commands:
/nl
/nuggetlist

When you open the prompt box to type players name you can click player's name in chat to copy it easier if it contains special characters.

The addon also auto sells grays and auto types "DELETE" when you try to delete epic+ items.
